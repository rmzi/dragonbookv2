Chapter 1 : Introduction
------------------------

Compiler: Software systems that translate a source program to a target program, i.e. C to Machine language

Interpreter: Directly executes operations specified in the source program on inputs supplied by the user

Ex. Java
  - Java has both.
    - Java -(compiles to)-> bytecodes -(interpreted by)-> VM
    - To have faster i/o Java uses JIT (just in time) compilers to translate bytecodes into machine language

Preprocessor: collects source program divided into modules stored in separate files
  - May also expand shorthands, called macros, into source language statements

Assembler: Sometimes, compilers produce an assembly-language program. The assembler produces relocatable machine code as its output.

Linker: Resolves external memory addresses, where code may refer to a location in another file

Loader: Puts together all of the executable object files into memory for execution
